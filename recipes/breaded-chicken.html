    <h1>Breaded Chicken</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 lb of chicken breasts (4-6 pieces)</li>
        <li>2 tbsps of olive oil</li>
        <li>2 eggs (beaten)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup of Italian seasoned breadcrumbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Thinly slice the chicken breasts. No thicker than half an inch.</li>
        <li>Lay slices on a large plate and add a pinch of salt and pepper to both sides.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, add both eggs and beat.</li>
        <li>In a separate plate add breadcrumbs - enough to cover the entire plate with a 1/4 inch layer of breadcrumbs. </li>
        <li>Prepare the saucepan: add oil and heat on medium-high.</li>
        <li>Once the pan is hot, grab each slice of chicken, put it inside the egg bowl to cover the entire surface with egg. Then put the slice on the plate with breadcrumbs and cover both sides completely with the breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Add each breaded slice to the hot pan. Cook chicken slices for approximately 6 minutes per side or until brown. Take chicken slices out of pan once cooked and set aside on a clean plate. </li>
    </ol>
