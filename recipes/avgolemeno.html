    <h1>Avgolemeno Soup</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken broth</li> 
        <li>Orzo (or rice)</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>3 limes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a pot boil the broth with orzo for approx 11 min or the time indicated in the orzo packet (or rice).</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs with the juice of the limes and a cup of chicken broth and keep it warm until the orzo or rice is ready. Read the below instructions to incorporate the eggs into the orzo/rice.</li>
        <li>The key to making this soup is properly tempering the eggs. Tempering means bringing the temperature up...slowly. Slowly temper the egg/lime mixture (up to medium heat) in another pot while the orzo cooks.</li>
        <li>You can then whisk the egg mixture into the hot soup pot and they won't curdle.</li>
    </ol>
