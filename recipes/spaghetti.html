    <h1>Spaghetti with Meat Sauce</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Half a box of spaghetti noodles</li>
        <li>1 lb (or 16oz) of ground beef</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of olive oil</li>
        <li>1 jar of traditional Marinara sauce</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste (start with a 1/4 teaspoon of each)</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 tsp of Dried Oregano</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <u>Noodles</u>
    <ol>
        <li>Use a large pot. Fill it up half way with water. Add a pinch of salt and a teaspoon of oil (this will avoid spaghetti noodles from sticking to each other) and bring to boil.</li>
        <li>Add spaghetti and boil in medium heat for approximately 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Use a fork to pull out a noodle to taste. Keep boiling if noodle is still raw.</li>
        <li>Once noodles are cooked use a colander to drain water. Set noodles aside. </li>
    </ol>
    <u>Meat Sauce</u>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large saucepan, add olive oil and set to med-high.</li>
        <li>As soon as oil is hot (before it smokes) add ground beef, salt, pepper, oregano and garlic.</li>
        <li>Mix and mash ground beef while cooking until brown and no large chunks are left.</li>
        <li>Add marinara sauce. Cook for another 5 minutes while mixing well.</li>
        <li>Turn heat to low and cover. Simmer for another 3 minutes. Add more salt if needed and mix well.</li>
        <li>Mix spaghetti with meat sauce and serve.</li>
    </ol>
